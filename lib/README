In order to run the scripts, install a virtual environment using the environment.yml file:

conda create --name myenv --file=environment.yml

TRY IF LINE ABOVE DOESNT WORK
conda env create --file=environment.yml 

conda activate myenv

Then, copy the files rbe_pyomo.py, cra_helper.py and pyomo_helper.py in DIR/anaconda/envs/myenv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/compas_cra/equilibrium where DIR points to your anaconda installation folder (they should replace existing files).

Ideas to focus on (pick at least 1):
- The policy should generate various kind of possible structures for a same task
- The policy should be able to complete an episode starting from some arbitrary/random situation not seen during training.
- Generate some interesting and novel structures
- Minimise the number of blocks used by the policy to complete the episode
- Use new types of block geometries
- Train a policy that is robust to noise injected when placing a block (important for sim2real transition to a real robot).
